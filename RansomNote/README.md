# Ransom Note Problem

>> We approached this problem in the days 27 and 28/08/2019

## Big O Analyse

We analyse the code using Big O notation in pursuit to find the best solution in terms of processing.

### Description of the Problem

We had two strings, one called magazine, and another called ran. We had to create a function that analyzes the ran string to determine if she contains all the strings in magazine and return true. Case not, return false. And, if ran contains more characteres compared with magazine, return false.

### Solution Found

The approach founded was using counting and iterate over the string. For doing that, we used lambda and filter that are builtin functions in python

### Testing

```
cd RansomNote
make run
```
